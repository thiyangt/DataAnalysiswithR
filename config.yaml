      This hands-on workshop aims to equip participants with the fundamentals of programming in R and give them skills needed to apply data analysis approaches to their research questions. The workshop will be taught in a similar style to Data Carpentry workshops. Data Carpentryâ€™s mission is to train researchers in the core data skills for efficient, shareable, and reproducible research practices.
