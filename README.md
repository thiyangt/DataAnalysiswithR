## Why R?

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. **R is a free, open-source programming language** that runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Linux, Windows and Mac OS. R is also among the [top-10](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/most-popular-programming-languages/) most popular and powerful programming languages.

R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, multivariate data analysis, spatial data aanalysis, machine learning, etc.) and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.
