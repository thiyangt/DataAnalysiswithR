In this workshop, we will be using the free and open-source program R, along with a user interface called RStudio. R works on pretty much every platform available, including the widely available Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux systems. 

The first thing you need to do to get started with R and RStudio is to install them on your computer. You must first download the latest version of **R** and install it. After that, you can download and install **RStudio**.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Info!</strong> Participants are expected to have their own computers, with R and Rstudio installed.
