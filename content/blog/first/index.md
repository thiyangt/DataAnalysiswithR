For this course, we will be using the free and open-source program R, along a user interface called RStudio. R works on pretty much every platform available, including the widely available Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux systems. 

The first thing you need to do to get started with R and RStudio is to install them on your computer. You must first download the latest version of R and install it. After that, you can download and install RStudio.
