## Why R?

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R programming language is widely used in academia and industry for data mining and data analysis.  R is also among the top-10 most popular and powerful programming languages.  R offers a variety of methods for statistical modelling, computing and data visualization. 

## About this workshop

In this workshop you will learn about the `tidyverse` R packages, a powerful set of tools for making stunning data visualizations and a useful way of statistical modelling.

The workshop will be taught in a similar style to Data Carpentry workshops. Data Carpentryâ€™s mission is to train researchers in the core data skills for efficient, shareable, and reproducible research practice


## Topics

We worked through the following sections in 6 hours:

- Introduction to R and Rstudio

- R programming basics

- Reproducible reporting with RMarkdown

- Data import and export

- Data wrangling 

- Data visualization 

- Introduction to Statistical modelling
