### Step 2.3

Save the .dmg file on your computer, double-click it, and then drag and drop it to your applications folder.

Remember, you must have R already installed before installing Rstudio. 


## 3. To check if the installation is successful

### Step 3.1

Open	RStudio by clicking the RStudio icon. Once you have RStudio opened, there should be several “windows”.

### Step 3.2

Go to the window named “Console” and type `1+3` and press enter as shown below. An	output line	reading	**`[1] 3`** should	appear.	This	means	that	R	and	RStudio	are	working.
